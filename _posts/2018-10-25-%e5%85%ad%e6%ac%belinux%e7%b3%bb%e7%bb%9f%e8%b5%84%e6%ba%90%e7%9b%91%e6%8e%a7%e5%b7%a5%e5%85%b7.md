<h3>Monitor server resources</h3>

System administrators need to monitor their server to ensure proper functioning. The practice enables administrators to detect possible issues in advance and recover the system, before it causes any trouble.

There are plenty of commands on Linux to monitor different system resources like cpu usage, memory usage, network, disk usage and so on. Popular ones are top, htop, iostat, nethogs etc.

In this post we are talking about simple command line tools that can monitor multiple system resources like cpu, memory, network, disk, processes etc all together in a real-time and interactive manner. These tools present a whole lot of statistical information on a single screen that is constantly updated.

<h3>1. Top</h3>

The Top command is the most popular tool to check the cpu and memory utilization processwise. It shows a sorted list of processes with the most resource intensive processes on the top.
Along with the process list it also shows cpu and memory usage.

Press 'h' while top is running, to display the help page.

<h3>2. Htop</h3>

This is your all time favorite tool. Similar to top, but much refined and carries a load of extra features along with a very good looking user interface. It is not installed by default, but is available in the default repositories of distros like Ubuntu and Fedora. CentOS users need to use an additional repository like epel or rpmforge to install it.

Here are some shortcuts to configure htop output interactively.

<pre class="highlight  ">M: Sort processes by memory usage
P: Sort processes by processor usage
?: Access help
k: Kill current/tagged process
F2: Setup htop. You can choose display options here.
/: Search processes</pre>

Refer to the man page to learn more about htop.

<h3>3. Atop</h3>

Atop is a tool to monitor system resources and processes. It shows the current usage levels of cpu, memory, disk and network along with a list of processes sorted by cpu usage in descending order. Similar to top and htop.

<h3>4. Nmon</h3>

Nmon is another very easy to use tool to monitor cpu, memory, networ, disk usage and process list on a single screen. Nmon works well as a reporting only tool but does not have any other feature or option to manage processes or modify the report display. It can save the statistics to a spreadsheet file.

<h3>5. Glances</h3>

Written in python, Glances is a reporting tool similar to Nmon that report statistics on cpu, memory, network, disk and processes. Apart from reporting the statistics, glances does not support any other feature or function.

Check our previous post on how to <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/glances-linux-system-monitor/">monitor system resources with Glances</a>.

Press 'h' while glances is running to access the help page.

<h3>6. Saidar</h3>

Saidar is the simplest of all tools. The output includes statistics on CPU, processes, load, memory, swap, network I/O, disk I/O, and file system information. The output does not mention the running processes at all.

<h3>7.Collectl</h3>

There are a number of times in which you find yourself needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using different tools, each designed to for that specific situation.

Unlike most monitoring tools that either focus on a small set of statistics, format their output in only one way, run either interatively or as a daemon but not both, collectl tries to do it all. You can choose to monitor any of a broad set of subsystems which currently include buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory, network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp.
